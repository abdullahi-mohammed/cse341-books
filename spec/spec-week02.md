# Books API Week 02 Spec - Version 1

## Feature 1: Book CRUD Operations and Author References

### Goal

Update the existing Week 01 book API so book documents include a reference to an author and the API supports all CRUD operations for books. Every book route must be documented and testable in Swagger.

### Data Model

Book documents will be stored in the `books` collection.

Required book fields:

- `id`: string, required, custom id such as `b1`
- `authorId`: string, required, references the `id` field of an author document
- `title`: string, required
- `publicationDate`: string, required

Books will continue to use custom string ids instead of MongoDB `_id` values for route parameters.

### Relationship to Authors

Each book will identify its author with an `authorId` field. The value of `authorId` must match the custom `id` value of an existing author document.

When creating or updating a book, the API should reject the request with a `400` status code if the submitted `authorId` does not match an existing author.

### Routes

#### GET /books

Purpose: Return all books.

Success:

- Status code: `200`
- Response body: an array of book objects

Errors:

- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs

#### GET /books/:id

Purpose: Return one book by its custom id.

Success:

- Status code: `200`
- Response body: the matching book object

Errors:

- `404` if no book exists with that id
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs

#### POST /books

Purpose: Create a new book.

Request body:

    {
      "id": "b4",
      "authorId": "a1",
      "title": "Example Book Title",
      "publicationDate": "2026-01-15"
    }

Success:

- Status code: `201`
- Response body: the newly created book object

Errors:

- `400` if a required field is missing
- `400` if the `id` already exists
- `400` if the `authorId` does not match an existing author
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs

#### PUT /books/:id

Purpose: Update an existing book.

Request body:

    {
      "authorId": "a2",
      "title": "Updated Book Title",
      "publicationDate": "2026-02-20"
    }

Success:

- Status code: `200`
- Response body: the updated book object

Errors:

- `400` if a required field is missing
- `400` if the `authorId` does not match an existing author
- `404` if no book exists with that id
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs

#### DELETE /books/:id

Purpose: Delete an existing book.

Success:

- Status code: `204`
- Response body: none

Errors:

- `404` if no book exists with that id
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs

### Swagger Documentation

Swagger must document every book route.

### Deployment Expectations

After implementation, the book routes must work locally and from the deployed Render application. The deployed Swagger page at `/api-docs` must allow someone to test every book route from the browser.

## Feature 2: Author CRUD Operations

### Goal

Add full CRUD operations for authors. Every author route must be documented and
testable in Swagger.

### Data Model

Author documents will be stored in the `authors` collection.

Required author fields:

- `id`: string, required, custom id such as `a1`
- `firstName`: string, required
- `lastName`: string, required

Authors will continue to use custom string ids instead of MongoDB `_id` values
for route parameters.

### Relationship to Books

Books reference authors through the book's `authorId` field. An author may not
be deleted while one or more books reference that author's custom `id`.

If a client tries to delete an author who still has books, the API should
reject the request with a `409` status code and leave both the author and its
books unchanged. The response should be a JSON object such as:

    {
      "error": "Cannot delete author while books reference this author"
    }

### Routes

#### GET /authors

Purpose: Return all authors.

Success:

- Status code: `200`
- Response body: an array of author objects

Example response:

    [
      {
        "id": "a1",
        "firstName": "Jane",
        "lastName": "Smith"
      }
    ]

Errors:

- `500` with a JSON error object if an unexpected server or database error occurs

#### GET /authors/:id

Purpose: Return one author by the author's custom id.

Success:

- Status code: `200`
- Response body: the matching author object

Example response:

    {
      "id": "a1",
      "firstName": "Jane",
      "lastName": "Smith"
    }

Errors:

- `404` with a JSON error object if no author exists with that id
- `500` with a JSON error object if an unexpected server or database error occurs

#### POST /authors

Purpose: Create a new author.

Request body:

    {
      "id": "a4",
      "firstName": "Example",
      "lastName": "Author"
    }

Success:

- Status code: `201`
- Response body: the newly created author object

Errors:

- `400` with a JSON error object if a required field is missing
- `400` with a JSON error object if the `id` already exists
- `500` with a JSON error object if an unexpected server or database error occurs

#### PUT /authors/:id

Purpose: Update an existing author. The `id` is supplied by the route
parameter and must not be changed by the request body.

Request body:

    {
      "firstName": "Updated",
      "lastName": "Author"
    }

Success:

- Status code: `200`
- Response body: the updated author object

Errors:

- `400` with a JSON error object if a required field is missing
- `404` with a JSON error object if no author exists with that id
- `500` with a JSON error object if an unexpected server or database error occurs

#### DELETE /authors/:id

Purpose: Delete an existing author who is not referenced by any books.

Success:

- Status code: `204`
- Response body: none

Errors:

- `404` with a JSON error object if no author exists with that id
- `409` with a JSON error object if one or more books still reference the author
- `500` with a JSON error object if an unexpected server or database error occurs

### Swagger Documentation

Swagger must document every author route, including each request body, success
response, and documented error response. The Swagger page must allow someone to
test every author route from the browser.

### Deployment Expectations

After implementation, the author routes must work locally and from the
deployed Render application. The deployed Swagger page at `/api-docs` must
allow someone to test every author route from the browser.
